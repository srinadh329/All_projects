         It is important to understand that all businesses processing users must be compliant with GDPR requirements, regardless of where they are based. Adherence to these new rules is particularly important for chatbots, which rely on user data to provide a personalized experience. We are in accordance with the GDPR compliance checklist and so can ensure that our bot meets the new requirements and provide users with access to their info and let users delete their data.

One of the best ways to improve chatbot performance is to monitor user interactions through chat logs. This helps you to gather all of the messages sent to the chatbot from different channels, get basic metrics such as most frequent intents out of all messages or by individual conversations, fix messages that have incorrect intents or entities directly in the panel and train the chatbot to expand its responses based on new user input.
