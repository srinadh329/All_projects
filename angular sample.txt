1.What is Angular?
Angular is Front End Frame work used to design web applications 
also if familir with develop SPA 
angular is developed in typeScript (Superset of javascript)

2. what is SPA
only one index.html is loaded all commponents to <app-root> </app-root>

3. how angular works
 first load main.ts in that appmodule bootstaping by platform browser
 on appmodule conists delcations, imports, providers
  in declarations we define component classes
  in imports we define Module (like material modules)
  in providers we define service clases
4.angular all data is configure with angular.json

5. all npm packages are scripts maintained in package.json

6.Component : Compent is buiding Block of UI elemnets
          (its render to  and it can resuable)
ng g c componentname
  

7.module:module is logic our application , divide the entrite application to smaller modules to perform lazy render
ng g m module name

8.servives are used to maintain backend  API functions
its can be resuable
ng g s servicename

9. Dependency Injection
We can create one service it can used to overall application instead of recreating all functions

10.data binding
i.{{}} source to view
ii. (click)="test()" view to source
iii. ([ngModel])="modelname" two way binding
iv. property binding
 [value]='job'
12.Directive 
 Directive is Us ed to change the behaviour of DOM Elemnet
 ng g d directivename
  i. component add selecter name of directive in required place
  ii. Structural Directive 
      *ngIf  *ngFor , *ngSwitch (multile cases)
   iii.Attribute Directives 
   [ngClass] , [ngStyle]

13.routing ( navigation from one view to another view)

wild card routers are used to redirect if invalid routernames given by user{path:'**',Error}


//////////
CRUD;

endponts (api) applcation progrm interface
create , read update , delete
 HTTP verbs or methods

create POST 
read GET
update PUT ,PATCH 
delete DELETE

POST (body) json formdata,xml

GET paramas(test/?id='test)

PUT OR PATCH (body with paramas) 

DELETE params



forms are used to capute the userdata in browser

groups of inputs validation and submition 
 which are come under form.value

angular forms two Template Driven Forms , Reactive Forms

TEmplateDriven Forms:
its similar to Normal HTML forms in order to Maintain ngModel for twoway binding We cannot Initialize forms with ts
erorr Handinging Bit complicate when compare to rective Forms



Reactive Forms:
No need to NgModels in it

we can Initialise forms with valadtions in souce or ts or ngoninit
Form group
FromBuilder
FormController
FormArray
Validaotors
SetValue
patchValue

how many type  angular life cycles
1.constructor
2.ngOnChanage
3.ngOninit
4.ngDocheck
5.ngAfterviewinit
6.ngAfterContentinit
7.ngAfterContentChecked
8.ngAfterViewChecked
9.ngOnDestroy



14. passing data from one compone to another componets
from parent to child @Input (in child) 
form child to parent @output (in child) with EventEmmiter

using observalbles , using ViewChild  (get the template element)

observables are used to make asynochtonous api calls 
also used to broadcast the data its send data to all subscribed methods
we can unscribethe observable at any time
we can set deboounce time to api calls
it will return no of events 

17.promise (resolve or reject)

promise is used to call asynchronous api or function calls it will return either reject or reslove 
reslove mean ssuccess data, reject means error 
it cannot be cannceled after calling



16.pipes pipes are used to transform the values 
it will take input and transform it and return it
there are two types predefined pipes and custom pipes






18. jwt Intercepters are middle ware its calling before and  after api calls or error call backs


20. viewEncasulation Provide scopes to styles
  emulate, none 

 1st <h1 clas=djd> </h1>
2ns <h1> </h1>

<h1>test></h1>
<app-child> <app-child>
view:nono

 
21. localStorage, sessionStorage, cookieStorage (web Storage apis)

22.angular js is java script frame work 
it work on mvc model

angualr is typescript frame work 
its wotk on mvvm model
its have component, 

rxjs is popular libraby used for observables , maps 


IVY enale ( decrese bundle size )

lasy loading 
inorder to load entire application we can load the child routes based on parent route

module is logic of our application we can divide the entire application into smaller applications 


JIT  just in time  ng serve
 code is compile in run time (complie in browser)
 AOT code is compiled in comile time
it will genetaed complied javascript bundle under dist folder
ng build --prod or ng build --aot




///

auth gaurds
gaurds are used to proved security to router navigation

ng g g authgaurd

CanActivate : its call before navigation
CanActivateChild: its call when child loads
CanDeactivate: its call router closed
CanLoad:its call when module load

Hostlisternst simmar lo event lisiterns


web apis
storage apis

localstorage is used to store key, value pair data in client browser 
it will access over entire browser
it will not clear automatically
localStorage.setItem('name','srinadh') for store
name = key , srinadh is data

localStorage.getItem('name') get value from storage

localStorage.removeItem('name') remove element from storage

localStorage.clear() clear all storage data

sessionstorage is used to storage data by key value pair
in client browser
it will accessable in single browser tab

it will clear when browser tab close
sessionStorage.setItem('name','srinadh');
sessionStorage.getItem('age');
sessionStorage.removeItem('age');
sessionStorage.clear();
